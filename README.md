# 👋 Hi, I’m Selva Ganesh 

I'm a developer who enjoys turning complex ideas into simple, visual tools.

Right now, I'm working on a low-code platform @Torus Innovations where users can build apps using drag-and-drop interfaces. I’ve built UI systems, visual editors, and backend logic that helps turn diagrams into working code.

I love clean design, thoughtful logic, and making tools that are actually fun to use.
